However, the broader geopolitical dynamics of the Cold War shaped the trajectory of the relationship. In 1955, Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact, later renamed the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), in which the United States held observer status, resulting in a limited strategic alignment between Washington and Islamabad.\\nIndia, prioritizing strategic autonomy and decolonization-era sovereignty, pursued an independent foreign policy and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, seeking to avoid formal alignment with either bloc during the Cold War. While India also developed close ties with the Soviet Union during this period, engagement with the United States continued in parallel through diplomacy, development assistance, and people-to-people exchanges. Differences over regional security, including U.S. support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, led to periods of strain, but did not sever bilateral ties.\\nThe end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point. India’s economic liberalization and the emergence of a unipolar world created new opportunities for convergence, leading both countries to reassess the relationship in light of shared democratic values and complementary interests.\\n\\n\\n=== Expansion into a comprehensive partnership ===\\nIn the twenty-first century, India’s foreign policy has emphasized strategic autonomy while actively engaging major global powers to advance national development and regional stability. This approach aligned with growing U.S. recognition of India as a key partner in Asia and beyond.\\nUnder the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, bilateral relations deepened substantially, with Washington acknowledging India’s core interests and supporting its ris'),\n",

It was the intention of those who wished for a Muslim state to have a clean partition between independent and equal \"Pakistan\" and \"Hindustan\" once independence came.\\nNearly one third of the Muslim population of India remained in the new India.\\nInter-communal violence between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims resulted in between 200,000 and 2 million casualties leaving 14 million people displaced.\\nPrincely states in India were provided with an Instrument of Accession to accede to either India or Pakistan.\\n\\n\\n== Wars ==\\n\\n\\n=== Indo-Pakistani war of 1947–1948 ===\\n\\nThe war, also called the first Indo-Pakistani war, started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharaja of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, princely states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal Islamic forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the Instrument of Accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949. India gained control of about two-thirds of the state (Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third of Kashmir (Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan). The Pakistan controlled areas are collectively referred to as Pakistan administered Kashmir.\\n\\n\\n=== Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 ===\\n\\nThis war started following Pakistan\\'s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. The hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and USA and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared.\\n\\n\\n=== Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 ===\\n\\nThis war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Leader of East Pakistan, and Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.\\nIndia intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement.

Although the Kashmir conflict was the predominant issue dividing the nations, other border disputes existed, most notably over the Rann of Kutch, a barren region in the Indian state of Gujarat. The issue first arose in 1956, which ended with India regaining control over the disputed area.

            "India and the United States established diplomatic relations in 1947 following the independence of India from the United Kingdom. Over the decades, the relationship has evolved into a broad-based strategic partnership grounded in shared democratic values, commitment to individual freedoms, and respect for the rule of law. As of 2025, India–United States relations encompass close cooperation across defense, technology, trade, education, and people-to-people ties, reflecting converging interests in promoting stability, prosperity, and a rules-based international order, even as differences persist on specific trade and energy issues.\n",
            "In early 2026, energy policy emerged as a point of discussion within India–United States relations, as analysts assessed whether India could shift a portion of its crude oil imports from Russia to Venezuela amid political pressure from the United States. Experts noted that such a transition would face logistical, economic, and contractual challenges, and that India had not formally committed to altering its existing oil procurement strategy. the United States and India announced a comprehensive trade agreement under which President Donald Trump stated that India agreed to halt purchases of Russian oil and to increase imports of U.S. and potentially Venezuelan crude, alongside broad tariff reductions on Indian goods. Indian officials said energy security and diversification remained key priorities, with Indian refiners requiring a wind-down period to complete previously booked Russian oil shipments and with no immediate directive to abruptly cease all Russian oil purchases. Data showed a significant decline in India’s Russian oil imports amid ongoing negotiations and Indian energy officials indicated a broadened sourcing strategy that included crude from other regions, reflecting a shift toward diversification without an immediate full withdrawal from Russian supplies.\n",

However, the broader geopolitical dynamics of the Cold War shaped the trajectory of the relationship. In 1955, Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact, later renamed the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), in which the United States held observer status, resulting in a limited strategic alignment between Washington and Islamabad.\n",

While India also developed close ties with the Soviet Union during this period, engagement with the United States continued in parallel through diplomacy, development assistance, and people-to-people exchanges. Differences over regional security, including U.S. support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, led to periods of strain, but did not sever bilateral ties.\n",
            "The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point.

Following partition, princely states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal Islamic forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the Instrument of Accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949. India gained control of about two-thirds of the state (Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third of Kashmir (Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan).

Hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared through UNSC Resolution 211 following a diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001–2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations.\n",

Although the two countries fought to a standoff, the conflict is seen as a strategic and political defeat for Pakistan, as it had not succeeded in fomenting an insurrection in Kashmir and was instead forced to shift gears in the defence of Lahore.
